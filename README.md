# Spreadsheet

A modular spreadsheet application built using **C#**, **.NET 8**, and **Blazor**, supporting real-time formula evaluation, dependency tracking, and an interactive grid-based UI.

## Features
- Formula Parser: Supports arithmetic expressions with operator precedence and parenthesis handling (e.g., `=A1+B2*C3`).
- Dependency Graph: Dynamically tracks cell relationships to prevent cycles and update dependent cells efficiently.
- Blazor GUI: Interactive grid UI built with Razor components and two-way data binding.
- Unit Tested: Core logic is rigorously tested with `xUnit`.
- Modular Design: Divided into independent projects (`Formula`, `DependencyGraph`, `Spreadsheet`, `GUI`).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- .NET 8
- Blazor
- C#
- xUnit (for unit testing)
