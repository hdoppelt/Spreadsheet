    <h1>About This Spreadsheet Application</h1><br />
    <p>Welcome to the Spreadsheet Application!</p>
    <p>This tool is designed to provide a simple and intuitive way to manage and compute data using cells, much like a standard spreadsheet. Below is a guide to help you understand how to use the interface and leverage the features available.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selecting Cells:</strong> Click on any cell in the grid to select it. The selected cell's name (e.g., A1, B2) will be displayed in the "Cell" field above the grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Editing Content:</strong> After selecting a cell, you can modify its contents by typing into the "Content" field. Enter a number, text, or a formula (e.g., <code>=A1 + B2</code>) and hit <strong>Enter</strong> or click outside the field to save the input.</li>
        <li><strong>Viewing Values:</strong> The evaluated result of the cell's content will be displayed in the grid and also in the "Value" field once the content is confirmed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Formula Syntax</h2>
    <p>You can input formulas into cells by typing <code>=</code> followed by an expression, such as <code>=A1 + B2</code> to sum two cells. The spreadsheet will automatically evaluate the formula and display the result in the grid.</p>
    <p>Formulas must adhere to certain syntax rules in order to be useful. For example, <code>5 + /</code> is not a valid formula because it can't evaluate to a number. Below are the rules for valid formula syntax:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>One Token Rule:</strong> There must be at least one token in the formula.</li>
        <li><strong>Valid Tokens:</strong> The only valid tokens are <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, variables, and numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Closing Parentheses Rule:</strong> The number of closing parentheses must never exceed the number of opening parentheses as you read the formula from left to right.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Parentheses Rule:</strong> The total number of opening parentheses must equal the total number of closing parentheses.</li>
        <li><strong>First Token Rule:</strong> The first token in a formula must be a number, a variable, or an opening parenthesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Last Token Rule:</strong> The last token in a formula must be a number, a variable, or a closing parenthesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Parenthesis/Operator Following Rule:</strong> Any token that follows an opening parenthesis or an operator must be either a number, a variable, or an opening parenthesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra Following Rule:</strong> Any token that follows a number, variable, or closing parenthesis must be an operator or a closing parenthesis.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Error Handling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Invalid Formula:</strong> If you enter a syntactically incorrect formula according to the above specification (e.g., <code>=A1 + "Text"</code>), the spreadsheet will notify you via a pop-up message, and the invalid formula will remain in the "Content" field until corrected.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula Error (Division by Zero):</strong> If a formula attempts to divide a value by zero, the value will result in a FormulaError. The invalid content will be saved in the cell and will need to be corrected.</li>
        <li><strong>Circular Dependency:</strong> If a formula creates a circular dependency (where two or more cells rely on each other), the spreadsheet will notify you via a pop-up message, and the content will not be updated. To resolve this, ensure that cells do not depend on each other in a loop.</li>
        <li><strong>SpreadsheetReadWriteException:</strong> This error occurs if there is an issue with saving or loading the spreadsheet file (e.g., file corruption or format issues). The spreadsheet will notify you with an error message, and the file operation will not be completed successfully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Save and Load</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Saving:</strong> To save your current spreadsheet data, click the <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the screen. This will store the current state of all cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Loading:</strong> You can load a previously saved file by clicking <strong>Load</strong> and selecting the appropriate file from your computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pop-Up Error Messages:</strong> Whenever an error is detected, an alert will display an error message indicating the issue with the specific cell.</li>
        <li><strong>Go High Mode:</strong> There is a button that makes the spreadsheet cells get <font color="#ff0000">"high"</font>, there is another button that will revert the cells back if you wat to read the cell values better.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear All Cells:</strong> This feature allows the user to clear the contents of every cell in the spreadsheet with a single click. It effectively resets the spreadsheet, removing all data and returning all cells to their initial empty state.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes for Users</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The spreadsheet currently supports basic arithmetic formulas and cell references.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all formulas are entered correctly to avoid errors.</li>
        <li>The interface is designed to provide immediate feedback for invalid input, ensuring a smooth user experience.</li>
    </ul>
